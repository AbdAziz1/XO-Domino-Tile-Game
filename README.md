# XO-Domino-Tile-Game

### The XO domino-tile game is played by 2 players using a square board. Players take turns to
enter the coordinates of 2 EMTPY squares (row-col, row-col) to place their domino-tiles, until
there is no possible move. We will illustrate the game using a 5x5 square board.

### o In the above board, if a player enters 00 10 for his next tile, it is invalid as
00 is already occupied.
o In the above board, if a player enters 11 12 for his next tile, it is invalid as
12 is already occupied.
o If player enters 21 32 for his next tile, it is invalid as the 2 squares are not
connected vertically or horizontally.
 Game ends when no player can place any more tile.
 Player with the most tiles on the board wins.
 If the result is a tie, repeat the game until a winner can be determined.
